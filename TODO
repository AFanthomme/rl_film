-Add check_zero_grad (make a "checks" module with logging or keep it in utils?)
 Add global debug file

-Write "TorchAgent" base class (having only 1 "decision_net") from which action is selected
  Different type of agents (dqn, reinforce, film) would be built on top of it

-Improve saves and writes (subfolders, avoid overwrite when loading through an offset attr)

-Maybe make a setup_cuda function to make things clearer
